A simple strawberry shrub recipe.

---

<ul>
    <li> 1 pint ripe strawberries </li>
    <li> 0.5 cup malt vinegar</li>
    <li> 1 cup Demerara sugar</li>
</ul>

Hull and dice strawberries and place them in a bowl. Cover the strawberries with half the sugar and stir until evenly coated. Add the rest of the sugar, stir again then cover and let macerate in the refrigerator for 1-2 days until all the sugar has dissolved. Strain off strawberry solids from the syrup.

Add the strawberry tops to a jar and cover with the malt vinegar. Let it sit at room temperature for 1 day, then strain the tops from the vinegar and add to the strawberry syrup.

The shrub will last approximately 6 months in the fridge.

Since shrub flavor heavily depends on the vinegar used try to pick a good quality vinegar for the recipe.
