A quick way to make a guava syrup.

---

* 200 g [guava paste](https://amzn.to/3T7V4uz)
* 0.5 cup water
* 0.5 cup [Demerara sugar](https://amzn.to/3yx7K72)
* 1 cup cane sugar

Combine guava paste with water and stir well, using an immersion blender can help speed up the process. Gradually add sugar and continue blending the mixture. A few rounds of heating up in the microwave will help dissolving the sugar. Once all sugar is incorporated pour the mixture into a bottle (it will be thick and puree like) and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
