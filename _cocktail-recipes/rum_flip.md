A flip from Savoy Cocktail Book.

---

<ul>
    <li> 2.75 oz Jamaican rum</li>
    <li> 0.25 oz allspice dram</li>
    <li> 1 tsp 2:1 Demerara syrup</li>
    <li> 1 whole egg</li>
</ul>

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

Surprisingly light drink despite having a whole egg in it. Allspice nicely comes through without overtaking the drink.
