An original recipe featuring a tropical [TexHex IPA](https://shiner.com/beer/texhex-passion-fruit/) from Shiner, TX and a flavorful blend of rums.

---

* 0.75 oz light rum (El Dorado 3)
* 0.5 oz dark rum (Black Seal Bermuda Dark)
* 0.25 oz Jamaican Pot Still Black rum (Hamilton, 46.5% ABV)
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz 2:1 syrup
* 3-4 oz TexHex Passionfruit Hazy IPA (Shiner)

Shake all ingredients except the beer with ice and pour into a Collins glass filled with crushed ice. Top off with beer.

The drink is nice and fresh with notes of passion fruit and other tropical fruit aromas. The blend of rums provides a robust backbone without overpowering the beer, and the touch of sweetness and tartness round out the drink. Overall this is a great summer sipper.
