An original recipe for a peach-infused bourbon sour, based on the prior work by McKenzie Nelson (see [Peach Bourbon Ice Pick](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/peach_ice_pick)).

---

* 2 oz <a href="/cocktails/infusions-recipes/peach_bourbon">peach-infused bourbon</a>
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz Amaro Montenegro
* 0.25 oz <a href="/cocktails/syrups-recipes/peach_syrup">peach syrup</a>

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass.

The cocktail is balanced and has nice peach notes from both the infused bourbon and the syrup. I wish the amaro stood out a touch more, since in this spec it's present but very subtle. Possibly using a more bitter and assertive amaro could yield a more complex cocktail.
