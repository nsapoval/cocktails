A variation on mezcal Negroni using Dubonnet instead of vermouth.

---

<ul>
    <li> 1 oz mezcal</li>
    <li> 1 oz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubonnet">Dubonnet</a></li>
    <li> 1 oz Campari</li>
</ul>

Stir all ingredients with ice and pour into a rocks glass over a large ice cube. Garnish with an orange peel.

I am quite fond of mezcal Negronis, so I tend to make many variations mixing and matching various vermouths and amaros. Dubonnet provides a good amount of added complexity and tends to survive in the fridge a touch longer than a typical vermouth would.
