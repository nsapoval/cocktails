An original recipe using matcha and infused vodka for a complex summery sour.

---

<ul>
    <li> 2 oz <a href="/cocktails/infusions-recipes/strawberry_apple_vodka">strawberry and apple vodka</a></li>
    <li> 0.5 tsp matcha powder</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz 2:1 syrup</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz lemon juice</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a coupe glass.

The cocktail ends up on the sweeter side with matcha and lemon balancing the sweetness and adding complexity. Strawberry is a natural pairing with matcha for my taste, but I believe this template could work with other fruit or berry infused spirits.
