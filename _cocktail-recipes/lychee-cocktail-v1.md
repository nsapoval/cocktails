An original recipe for a sparkling lychee flavored cocktail.

---

* 1 oz white rum
* 0.75 oz lemon juice
* 1 barspoon 2:1 syrup
* 4 oz sparkling lychee soju

Shake all ingredients except the soju with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass. Top off with sparkling soju and optionally garnish with a single lychee fruit (no pit).

---

The drink is bright and floral with acidity form the lemon helping offset the sweetness of lychee soju. I used a very neutral Flor de Ca√±a white rum for this drink, but I believe it can be made more interesting by using a mild agricole rum (e.g. [Dillon Rhum Agricole Blanc 40% ABV](https://www.rhums-dillon.com/nos-gammes/rhums-blancs/rhum-blanc-dillon-40deg)) instead.
