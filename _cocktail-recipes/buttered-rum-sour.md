A simple original sour recipe with brown butter fat-washed rum.

---

* 2 oz [brown butter washed rum](/cocktails/infusions-recipes/brown-butter-rum/)
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz dark brown sugar 2:1 syrup
* 0.25 oz banana liqueur

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass.

Balanced with bright buttery caramel and rum flavors in the front, and subtle molasses and banana nuances in the aftertaste. This is a very good drink reminiscent of a caramel filled candy.
