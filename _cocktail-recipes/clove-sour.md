A sour featuring clove syrup, Fernet Branca and bourbon.

---

* 1.5 oz bourbon (Wild Turkey 101)
* 1 oz lemon
* 0.5 oz clove syrup v1
* 0.25 oz Fernet Branca

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.

The cocktail turns out quite fresh and acidic with a light touch of spice and herbal complexity.
