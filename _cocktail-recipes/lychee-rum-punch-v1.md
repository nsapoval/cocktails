An original recipe for a strong tropical rum punch.

---

* 1 oz Jamaican overproof white rum ([William Price 124 proof](https://www.williampricedistilling.com/spirits))
* 0.5 oz [Batavia Arrack](https://alpenz.com/product-batavia.html)
* 0.25 oz Jamaican Pot Still Black Rum ([Hamilton](https://www.caribbean-spirits.com/labeldetails.php?id=52))
* 0.5 oz Falernum
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 4 oz sparkling lychee soju

Combine all ingredients except the soju in the shaker and shake with ice. Strain into a Collins glass packed with crushed ice. Top off with lychee soju and optionally garnish with a lychee fruit.

The mix of rums is strong and funky so the extra dilution from crushed ice is needed to keep this drink balanced. The sparkling soju top off keeps the aromas floral and fresh creating an interesting layering of flavors.
