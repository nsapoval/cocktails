A clarified rum punch following the clarification tips and tricks from [Truffles On The Rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74fsCUdQAtw).

---

* 1.75 cups [brown butter washed rum](/cocktails/infusions-recipes/brown-butter-rum/)
* 0.25 cup blackstrap rum (Cruzan)
* 1 oz allspice dram
* 1 cup lemon juice
* 1 cup black tea 2:1 syrup
* 1.5 cups milk

Combine all ingredients except milk in a large container and then pout the mixture over the milk. Let stand for 30 minutes. Filter through a cheesecloth and coffee filter setup (make sure the two filtering layers do not fit too tightly together). Bottle and refrigerate, will keep in the fridge for at least a month.

Extremely mellow and balanced cocktail with a nice silky texture from the milk proteins. The allspice dram and blackstrap rum add complexity and spice to the punch.
