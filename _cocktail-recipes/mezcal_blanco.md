This follows the same blueprint as a mezcal negroni, but swaps sweet vermouth and Campari for their white "counterparts". Dolin Blanc is a fun vermouth to have around, since it ends up being sweeter than the dry vermouths and hence swaps for sweet vermouth more organically. The Bianco amaro is not quite as intense as Campari, so this is drink can be a good introduction to bitter flavors.
