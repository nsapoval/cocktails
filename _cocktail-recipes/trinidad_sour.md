Rich and intense cocktail from Giuseppe Gonz√°lez that features a one and a half once pour of Angostura bitters

---

<ul>
    <li> 1.5 oz Angostura bitters</li>
    <li> 0.5 oz rye whiskey (Rittenhouse)</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz lemon juice</li>
    <li> 1 oz orgeat</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.

This cocktail is my guilty pleasure and the main reason why the big bottle of Angostura bitters never has its dasher top in place. It is rich both in flavor profile and in texture due to Angostura bitters and orgeat.
