For the nuclear amount of alcohol in this drink it's surprisingly balanced and palatable. Angostura brings the spice and complexity, while the blend of rums provides strong flavors of ripe banana, sugarcane and molasses. Passion fruit and guava provide nice tropical fruit background to the intense rum blend. Overall, would not recommend this to people unless served as a 2-4 person split drink or as the only drink for the evening.
