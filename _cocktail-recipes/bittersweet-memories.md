Another riff on Bitter Rival from the [Wooster's Garden](https://www.woostersgarden.com/). This time (nearly) an equal parts sour.

---

* 1 oz Campari
* 1 oz gin
* 1 oz lime juice
* 0.75 oz pomegranate molasses
* 0.25 oz 2:1 syrup
* 1 bar spoon orange blossom water
* 10 drops saline solution (20%)

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass.

The drink is very tart and bold. Campari pairs well with pomegranate molasses and the orange blossom water adds additional aromatic complexity.
