A small twist on a classical recipe combining gin, cucumber, and basil.

---

<ul>
    <li> 2 oz gin</li>
    <li> 1 oz lemon juice</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz St. Germain elderflower liq</li>
    <li> 1 barspoon Suze</li>
    <li> 5 coins of cucumber quartered</li>
    <li> 5 leaves basil</li>
</ul>

Muddle cucumbers with gin in the shaker, combine all ingredients and shake with ice. Double strain into a coupe.

Adding a barspoon of Suze amplifies the vegetal tones of this cocktail while the cucumber, lemon and elderflower bring fresh summer tones to the pallette.
