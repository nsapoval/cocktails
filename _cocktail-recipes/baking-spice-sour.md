An original recipe for a spicy balanced sour with bright autumn tones.

---

* 1 oz bourbon (Wild Turkey 101)
* 1 oz rye whiskey (Rittenhouse 100)
* 0.75 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz maple syrup
* 0.25 2:1 syrup
* 15 drops clove tincture
* 15 drops Angostura bitters

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.

This drink starts out surprisingly mellow, but quickly unravels layers of spice with clove from tincture and cinnamon and allspice from the Angostura bitters. The rye whiskey split base helps it maintain crispy spice, while the bourbon and syrups mellow out the finish balancing the acidity. You can also swap bourbon for applejack for an apple pie flavored cocktail perfect for an autumn evening.
