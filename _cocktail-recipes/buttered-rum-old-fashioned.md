The light spice from allspice dram and Angostura bitters compliments the rich smoothness of butter washed rum. Molasses heavy dark brown sugar integrates well with dark and aged rums, and provides a further touch of burnt caramel flavor that accompanies the caramel aroma of brown butter. If you have no allspice dram on hand, you can do without it in a pinch and compensate by adding another spoon of syrup and a few more dashes of Angostura bitters.
