I tasted Bitter Rival over at the [Wooster's Garden](https://www.woostersgarden.com/) recently and really enjoyed the idea of combining Campari with pomegranate molasses and orange blossom water. The recipe below is my take on this cocktail.

---

* 1.5 oz Campari
* 0.5 oz gin
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 0.25 oz pomegranate molasses
* 1 bar spoon orange blossom water
* 10 drops saline solution (20%)

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain over a large cube into a rocks glass.

This version ended up a bit more Campari forward than the one over at the Wooster's Garden, part of that might be due to me not using crushed ice, and part due to the specs. Orange blossom water is a lot more prominent in this version, so a bar spoon feels like a good amount for bright, but not overpowering orange blossom aroma. I wouldn't mind a touch more pomegranate molasses and maybe a bar spoon of 2:1 syrup here, but I think it works well as is too.
