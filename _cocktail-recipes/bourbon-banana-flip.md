I wasn't able to quickly find a full reference for this cocktail but the description credits Sam Ross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samueljoelross/?hl=en"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a>. 

### Bourbon Banana Flip

* 1.5oz bourbon
* 0.75oz banana liqueur
* 0.5oz 2:1 syrup
* 0.5oz heavy cream
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

The drink turned out very pleasant albeit a touch too sweet for my taste. Bourbon comes through and banana flavor is present, but subtle. This is a great dessert drink recipe and a good use of banana liqueur.
