An original recipe inspired by Trinidad Sour showcasing a nice homemade allspice dram.

---

<ul>
    <li> 1.5 oz allspice dram</li>
    <li> 0.5 oz overproof white Jamaican rum</li>
    <li> 1 oz lime juice</li>
    <li> 0.5 oz Falernum</li>
    <li> 3 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass. Optionally garnish with a dehydrated lime wheel.

This is a spicy and complex cocktail with allspice dram driving the flavor profile. Falernum adds a clove note, and helps with balancing the drink. Overproof Jamaican rum stays in the background and acts as a support for the main flavors. Given the spice bite of this sour it would act well as an aperitif or could be paired with vanilla ice cream as a dessert.
