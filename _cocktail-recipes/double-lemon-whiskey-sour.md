An original riff on the whiskey sour that doubles down on the lemon flavors by incorporating <a href="/cocktails/blog/2024/rnd-limoncello-1/">limoncello</a> into the cocktail.

---

* 1 oz bourbon
* 1 oz rye whiskey
* 1.25 oz limoncello
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz Amaro Montenegro
* 1 dash Angostura bitters
* 1 egg white (optional)

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe glass and garnish with a few drops of Angostura bitters.

Limoncello adds a long lemon peel infused finish to this cocktail.
