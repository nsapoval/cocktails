Rhum agricole works well with Suze and I prefer the higher proof version since it stands up to the amaro better. I would suggest playing with the amount of Suze in this drink, namely 1 barspoon and 0.25 oz of Suze are both valid options that lead to a less bitter and more Falernum accented versions. Another possible adjustment would be to up the lime juice to a full ounce, while adding a barspoon or 0.25 oz of 2:1 syrup, for a more classical sour taste.
