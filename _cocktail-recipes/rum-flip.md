This is an old time classic flip that can accommodate a variety of rums. I prefer to use dark Jamaican rum here for a more bold and complex profile.

* 1.5 oz dark rum
* 0.5 oz heavy cream
* 0.25 oz 2:1 syrup
* 1 whole egg

Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake without ice. Add ice and shake again, strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.

I swapped 0.5 oz of the dark rum for blackstrap rum for a more molasses forward drink. The result is pleasant with coffee and chocolate notes from the dark rums and nice silky texture from the egg.
