An interesting cocktail combining green Chartreuse and Campari.

---

* 1 oz green Chartreuse 
* 1 oz Campari
* 1 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz 2:1 syrup
* 3-4 drops saline solution (20%)

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled Nick and Nora glass.

Due to the lack of green Chartreuse proper I substituted 0.75 oz of the [herbal elixir of Chartreuse](https://www.chartreuse.fr/en/produit/vegetable-elixir/) and added an additional 0.25 oz of 2:1 syrup (the elixir is unsweet). FUrthermore the 0.5 oz of 2:1 syrup can be substituted for Demerara 2:1 syrup for a slightly more caramel tones in the drink. Overall this is a surprisingly balanced and mellowed out drink despite having two very bold ingredients on its list.
