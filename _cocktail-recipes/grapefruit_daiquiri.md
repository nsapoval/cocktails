An original recipe that relies on grapefruit superjuice to make a balanced Daiquiri.

---

<ul>
    <li> 2 oz light rum</li>
    <li> 1 oz grapefruit superjuice</li>
    <li> 0.5 oz 2:1 syrup</li>
    <li> 0.25 oz grenadine</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a coupe glass.

The cocktail has very bright grapefruit flavor. Grenadine helps with the color and brings in a bit of additional tartness and complexity.
