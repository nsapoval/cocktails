* 1 oz rye whisky
* 1 oz Cynar
* 0.5 oz Cointreau
* 0.25 oz [clove 2:1 syrup](/cocktails/blog/2024/rnd-clove-syrup)
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

The drink is very bold thanks to the 100 proof rye whisky and Cynar, but rich and creamy at the same time. This flip has a nice balance of bitterness, sweetness and rich mouthfeel that seems appropriate for a nightcap.
