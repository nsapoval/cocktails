A fun cocktail featuring [Underberg bitters](https://underbergamerica.com/) by Nick Kokonas from [Avondale Bowl](https://www.avondalebowl.com/) in Chicago via [Imbibe Magazine](https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/cash-and-prizes-a-rye-highball/).

---

* 1.5 oz rye whiskey (Rittenhouse)
* 1.5 oz Lillet Rouge 
* 1 bottle [Underberg bitters](https://amzn.to/4fCUu1q)
* 4 oz tonic water

Stir all ingredients except tonic water with ice until well chilled, pour into a rocks glass over ice. Top off with tonic water.

The drink is complex and herbal, but refreshing and sippable at the same time. In a pinch Lillet Rose can also work and will yield a touch lighter cocktail than the Rouge would. This is also one of the recipes where spending a few extra dollars on a better tonic water can go a long way.
