An original recipe for a spritz with carbonated lychee soju.

---

* 0.5 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz Falernum
* 3 oz sparkling lychee soju

Combine lime juice and Falernum in a well-chilled glass and stir briefly to mix. Top off with sparkling lychee soju. Alternatively, you can build this drink over pebble ice in a rocks glass in the same manner.

I prefer this made up, since Falernum and lychee experience a unique marriage of flavors that yields multi-layered floral aromas and a nuanced interplay of spices, sweetness and light tartness.
