An original recipe that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarinquat">mandarinquat</a> superjuice.

    <li> 1 oz 2:1 syrup</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into small coupe glass.

I call this cocktail "inverted" since we use the souring agent (mandarinquat superjuice) as the dominant ingredient by volume, as opposed to a traditional spirit base. The use of overproof rum in this case balances out the volume difference. It's a bright and balanced sour that focuses on flavors of a less common citrus used in it.
