A refreshing sour that uses <a href="https://www.kevinkos.com/post/kumquat-super-juice">kumquat superjuice</a> for acidity.

<ul>
    <li> 1.5 oz gin</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz kumquat superjuice</li>
    <li> 0.75 oz St. Germaine Elderflower liqueur</li>
    <li> 1.5 oz sparkling wine</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients except the sparkling wine with ice and pour into a coupe glass. Top off with sparkling wine and optionally garnish with a very thin kumquat slice.

A balanced aromatic cocktail with layers of floral and citrus complexity. Sparkling wine helps amp up the refreshing qualities of a sour. A great way to ease into the spring mood at the tail end of winter.
