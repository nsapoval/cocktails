* 2 oz The Scarlet Ibis Trinidad Rum
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz 2:1 syrup
* 0.25 oz allspice dram

Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.

I up the lime juice from 0.75 to 1 oz in this drink, as I prefer it a touch more tart and bright. The allspice dram plays very nicely with the rum, and while there isn't too much funk in this rum it still has a formidable complexity.
