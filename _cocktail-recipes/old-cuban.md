Great cocktail from 2001 created by Audrey Saunders. I only discovered this very recently while dining at the [Cafe Piquet](https://www.cafepiquet.net/) in Houston, TX.

---

* 1.5 oz aged rum (El Dorado 5 or 8)
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 0.66 oz 2:1 syrup
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters
* 6 mint leaves
* 2 oz sparkling wine

Muddle leaves with sugar in the shaker, then add remaining ingredients except the sparkling wine and shake with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe glass and top off with sparkling wine. Garnish with a lime wheel and mint sprig.

The cocktail is very well balanced and refreshing thanks to the mint. The aged rum adds complexity and ANgostura bitters add a note of spices to the mix.
