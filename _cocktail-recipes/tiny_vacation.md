An original recipe that scales down the volume of a typical sour for an unusual presentation.

---

<ul>
    <li> 1 oz overproof Jamaican white rum</li>
    <li> 0.25 oz ginger juice</li>
    <li> 0.25 oz 2:1 syrup</li>
    <li> 0.5 oz lime juice</li>
</ul>

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into small coupe glass.

This cocktail ends up being noticeably smaller than a typical sour, so having an appropriate small coupe is the key for presentation. Despite its size the full ounce of the overproof rum makes this cocktail a fair aperitif drink.
