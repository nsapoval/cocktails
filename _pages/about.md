I'm Nick and I have been passionate about cocktails since my junior year of college. I have never worked in a real bar, but I enjoy making drinks at home and helping with drink programs at friends's parties and events. Over the several years of making cocktails I have experimented with different recipes and techniques, as well as developed a few personal recipes. This website is the organized collection of some of my knowledge on the topic of cocktails.
