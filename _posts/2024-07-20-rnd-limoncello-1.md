We will be using <a href="https://www.kevinkos.com/post/lemoncello-easier-n-cheaper">Kevin Kos's</a> proportions for making limoncello. The main experiment will consist of comparing the results from fresh lemon peels to the one obtained with the lemon peels used to make lemon super juice.

## Main recipe

* 35 g lemon peels
* 210 ml neutral gran spirit (75.5% ABV)
* 315 ml water
* 105 g sugar

**Target ABV:** ~30%; **Target sugar (g/L):** 200

---

Combine lemon peels with the grain spirit in a jar and seal tightly. Let sit for 2 to 3 days periodically shaking the jar to stir around the contents. Combine sugar with water and stir to dissolve, then add infused spirit (filtering out the peels). Stir all ingredients together and bottle. Limoncello will instantly get cloudy. 

## Fresh vs reused peels

I made a batch of lemon superjuice with 35 g of peels, and then after blending the superjuice together, filtering and bottling, I retained the processed peels. From there onwards th two recipes are identical in ingredients and infusion times. Unsurprisingly the fresh peel limoncello is a lot brighter in color, so it wins the presentation game.

What's more interesting is that the reused peel limoncello still tastes reasonably good. However, it has a slightly artificial lemon flavor akin to that in bad flavored vodkas or cheap lemonades. I suspect this off flavor comes from the trace amounts of citric acid that likely got carried over from the superjuice process with the peels. The amount is not enough to make the final product sour, but it is enough to add a slightly chemical aftertaste to the drink.

The fresh peel limoncello is bright not only in its color but in the aroma and flavor as well. It also has a nice long finish from the extracted lemon oils. It is pleasant to drink on its own as a desert liqueur, but of course we will try to make a few cocktails with it as well.

## Cocktails

A super simple sipper we can make with limoncello is simply combining 2 ounces of limoncello with about 6 oz of tonic water in a Collins glass with a bunch of ice. The drink is refreshing, but quite complex thanks to the bitterness of the tonic and lemon essential oils in the limoncello. This is a great long drink for a hot summer and it could pair well with light vegetable appetizers or a nice cheese plate. 

Now, that we have a simple summer drink down let's explore the possibilities offered by limoncello. The first challenge I wanted to solve in making a more complex cocktail featuring limoncello was addressing the acidic component of the drink. Conceptually there are a few ways this can be solved: (1) double down on the lemon and use juice, (2) become ~~Sprite~~ "lemon-lime soda" and use a different citrus juice, or (3) use a non-citrus source of acidity. All of these solutions have their time and place, but I didn't want to do either (1) or (2). The lemons on lemons just doesn't sound too appealing at the moment, and the lemon-lime combination usually feels like a generic citrus flavor in so far as it muddies the nuance of the individual citrus used. 

With all this being said, this section is largely experimental, and hence results may vary. If you are looking for a less creative, but more stable cocktail [jump here](#double-lemon-whiskey-sour).

Now, what are some alternative souring agents we could use? I made a <a href="/cocktails/other-recipes/strawberry-superjuice/">strawberry superjuice</a> before, and it'll likely work well with limoncello for a pink lemonade inspired cocktail. Given that limoncello is sweet, but still far from a syrup, I suspect that the following cocktail could work:

### Pretty Pink Palette

* 1 oz gin
* 1.5 oz limoncello
* 1 oz strawberry superjuice
* 1 barspoon 2:1 syrup

Now, a fair warning is that this cocktail hasn't been tested yet, so proportions might need to get tweaked a bit. I also suspect that putting the result into a Collins glass, topping of with soda and garnishing with a nice mint sprig/bunch would end up quite well. 

Another alternative souring agent is hibiscus. Hibiscus not only provides a spectacular shade of purplish red to any liquid it touches, but also acidifies the infusion making it a nice way to build a sour. There are different ways to integrate hibiscus into a cocktail, but I'll go with the simplest option and just brew a quick hibiscus tea on the side first. We will use about 20 grams of dried hibiscus for about 1.5 cups of boiling water. After combining we will let the tea steep for about 10-15 minutes. 

### Hibiscus Lemonade v0 (bad)

* 1 oz gin
* 1.5 oz limoncello
* 1 oz hibiscus tea
* 1 barspoon 2:1 syrup 

The drink turns a nice shade of purple red, but it doesn't taste good. Several things go wrong here at once: (1) limoncello ends up being too sweet and the hibiscus tea simply can't balance it in these proportions; (2) the ABV in this drink ends up quite high, which doesn't work too well with a more subtle hibiscus tea. We can rectify these problems by adjusting ingredient proportions.

### Hibiscus Lemonade v1

* 1 oz gin
* 1 oz limoncello
* 2 oz hibiscus tea
* 1 barspoon 2:1 syrup 

This version tastes more balanced and closer to a typical sour. It has nice hibiscus front and long lemon finish thanks to the limoncello. I am not fully satisfied with this drink even though it is definitely a solid attempt at a summery limoncello cocktail. I believe that a way to make this both more balanced and more exciting would require making a non-sweetened Sorel and using it in place of hibiscus tea. I might try this idea later in the future.

However, similarly to what I've mentioned for the strawberry version I believe that this can be made into an even more summery highball by adding soda water. Unlike  the strawberries, the hibiscus doesn't seem to pair with mint that well in my perception, so we will skip that component. Furthermore, instead of adding soda water to our cocktail, we will make a more diluted version of the cocktail and then carbonate the whole thing in an iSi whipper with some CO2 cartridges. At some point in the future I probably will write a more detailed post about carbonation, but for now we will follow a simple guide:

1. Cocktail in the iSi whipper goes into fridge for at least 30 minutes
2. Add 1 cartridge CO2, shake, release gas, back to fridge for at least 30 minutes.
3. Add 1 more cartridge CO2, shake, release gas, back to fridge for at least 30 minutes and ideally overnight.
4. Degas, unscrew top and pour into glass.

The adjusted recipe scaled to yield roughly 600 ml of the total carbonated cocktail is below.

### Carbonated Hibiscus Lemonade

* 3 oz gin
* 4 oz limoncello
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 6 oz hibiscus tea
* 6 oz water 

The end result is a lot better than the previous two versions. The two CO2 charges make the drink quite fizzy. Lemon leads the flavor profile, but the hibiscus is noticeable. As with all the other cocktails in this post the aftertaste is mostly lemon oils. Overall this is a pleasant summer cocktail that can be pre-batched for a party. It has nice complexity and very appealing color, and carbonation adds a bit of extra fun for the presentation.

Finally, we will wrap with a modified whiskey sour by doubling down on lemon flavors. While this is a lot less interesting since we are using lemon juice alongside our limoncello, it still yields a fun cocktail with a reasonably new twist.

### Double Lemon Whiskey Sour

* 1 oz bourbon
* 1 oz rye whiskey
* 1.25 oz limoncello
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz Amaro Montenegro
* 1 dash Angostura bitters
* 1 egg white (optional)

If using egg white dry shake first, then shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a Nick and Nora glass.

I am currently trying the version without egg white and it has a nice bright acidic bite to it. The whiskeys interplay well with the ingredients with the light spice of rye aligning with amaro and bitters. The lemon flavor is bright in the beginning and transforms into a nice lemon oil aftertaste. Depending on personal preferences a barspoon or two of 2:1 syrup can make this cocktail a bit more balanced for some people.
