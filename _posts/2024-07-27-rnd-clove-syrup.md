Recently, I wanted to make [Cynar Flip](cocktails/cocktail-recipes/cynar-flip) cocktail which calls for clove simple syrup. The recipe I [found online](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cynar-flip/) originally called for a preference based amount of cloves simmered in water which is then used to make a 1:1 syrup. Looking a bit more around the web, I found two more recipes: [one](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/clove-syrup) calling for 1.5 tsps of cloves which are then coarsely ground and boiled in the water used to make a 1:1 syrup, and [the other](https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/clove-syrup-recipe/) calling for 1/3 cup of whole cloves and a simmer of all ingredients together for a 1:1 syrup. 

All of the above recipes share two commonalities that I wanted to challenge for the syrup I wanted to make. First, I am used to working with 2:1 syrups due to their shelf-stability, and hence I am more familiar with calibrating recipes based on sweetness of a 2:1 syrup. Second, recently I started dabbling into making tinctures and extracts that can be added in minute (using a dropper) amounts to flavor large volumes, thus opening the door to making flavored syrups by combining tincture/extract with neutral 2:1 syrup base. In particular, the reasoning for the second design choice comes from the observation that 2:1 syrup is typically abundant in my setup and is shelf-stable, analogously a tincture is also shelf stable, and hence, we can make small batches of flavored syrup when we need it, instead of making and storing a large amount of a flavored syrup. In the case of clove syrup this is particularly appealing since there aren't many drinks that call fo rit explicitly.

Thus, we will be testing two recipes for 2:1 clove syrup side by side, the first recipe will follow the boil and infuse strategy, while the second recipe will involve adding small amount of clove tincture to the 2:1 syrup base.

### Clove Syrup v1

* 10 g cloves (about 1.5 tbsp)
* 0.5 cup water
* 1 cup sugar

Coarsely grind the cloves and combine with sugar and water in a pot. Simmer on medium heat occasionally stirring until the sugar dissolves. Take of the heat and let infuse covered for 30 minutes to an hour. Strain, filter and bottle.

### Clove Syrup v2

* 6 g cloves (about 1 full tbsp)
* 60 ml neutral grain spirit (75.5% ABV)

Coarsely grind the cloves and combine with the grain spirit in a small glass jar. Let the mixture infuse for at least 48 hours, after two weeks filter out the solids and bottle. 

Use 10 drops per standard cocktail.

## Comparison

I combined 2 oz of water with 0.5 oz of clove syrup (v1), and 0.5 oz of regular 2:1 syrup and 10 drops of clove tincture (v2) for tasting purposes. Both syrups had strong clove aromas with the tincture based one being a touch sharper and brighter on the nose. However, once tasted the v1 has an evenly incorporated clove flavor that carried throughout the whole mixture, while v2 had less persistent taste. Furthermore, v2 tasted overall sweeter with sugar syrup having a more clear presence. 

Overall for the cocktails, I believe that for a few ingredients stirred cocktails, as well as for flips the v1 is the way to go. For the drinks with the clove aroma is of essence, but the prolonged clove flavor is not as important the v2 is a better alternative.

As a bonus feature I decided to add a few cocktails I have recently made with either of the syrup options.

## Cocktails

### [Clove Sour v1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/clove-sour)

* 1.5 oz bourbon (Wild Turkey 101)
* 1 oz lemon
* 0.5 oz clove syrup v1
* 0.25 oz Fernet Branca

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.

The cocktail turns out quite fresh and acidic with a light touch of spice and herbal complexity.

### [Baking Spice Sour v1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/baking-spice-sour)

* 1 oz bourbon (Wild Turkey 101)
* 1 oz rye whiskey (Rittenhouse 100)
* 0.75 oz lemon juice
* 0.5 oz maple syrup
* 0.25 2:1 syrup
* 15 drops clove tincture
* 15 drops Angostura bitters

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.

This drink starts out surprisingly mellow, but quickly unravels layers of spice with clove from tincture and cinnamon and allspice from the Angostura bitters. The rye whiskey split base helps it maintain crispy spice, while the bourbon and syrups mellow out the finish balancing the acidity. You can also swap bourbon for applejack for an apple pie flavored cocktail perfect for an autumn evening.
