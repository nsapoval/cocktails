Recently, I wanted to make [Cynar Flip](cocktails/cocktail-recipes/cynar-flip) cocktail which calls for clove simple syrup. The recipe I [found online](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cynar-flip/) originally called for a preference based amount of cloves simmered in water which is then used to make a 1:1 syrup. Looking a bit more around the web, I found two more recipes: [one](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/clove-syrup) calling for 1.5 tsps of cloves which are then coarsely ground and boiled in the water used to make a 1:1 syrup, and [the other](https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/clove-syrup-recipe/) calling for 1/3 cup of whole cloves and a simmer of all ingredients together for a 1:1 syrup. 

All of the above recipes share two commonalities that I wanted to challenge for the syrup I wanted to make. First, I am used to working with 2:1 syrups due to their shelf-stability, and hence I am more familiar with calibrating recipes based on sweetness of a 2:1 syrup. Second, recently I started dabbling into making tinctures and extracts that can be added in minute (using a dropper) amounts to flavor large volumes, thus opening the door to making flavored syrups by combining tincture/extract with neutral 2:1 syrup base. In particular, the reasoning for the second design choice comes from the observation that 2:1 syrup is typically abundant in my setup and is shelf-stable, analogously a tincture is also shelf stable, and hence, we can make small batches of flavored syrup when we need it, instead of making and storing a large amount of a flavored syrup. In the case of clove syrup this is particularly appealing since there aren't many drinks that call fo rit explicitly.

Thus, we will be testing two recipes for 2:1 clove syrup side by side, the first recipe will follow the boil and infuse strategy, while the second recipe will involve adding small amount of clove tincture to the 2:1 syrup base.

### Clove Syrup v1

* 10 g cloves (about 1.5 tbsp)
* 0.5 cup water
* 1 cup sugar

Coarsely grind the cloves and combine with sugar and water in a pot. Simmer on medium heat occasionally stirring until the sugar dissolves. Take of the heat and let infuse covered for 30 minutes to an hour. Strain, filter and bottle.

### Clove Syrup v2

* 6 g cloves (about 1 full tbsp)
* 60 ml neutral grain spirit (75.5% ABV)

Coarsely grind the cloves and combine with the grain spirit in a small glass jar. Let the mixture infuse for at least 48 hours, after two weeks filter out the solids and bottle.
