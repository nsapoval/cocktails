[Lychee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee) is a great fruit that I tend to associate with late spring and summer. It's sweet, fragrant, and fresh tasting, and it's not too hard to find in major US cities (either at an Asian grocery store or specialty food store). For a while I have been thinking of incorporating lychee into summer cocktails. Back in college I found a bottle of lychee liqueur in a liquor store in Chicago's Chinatown. It was a quite versatile liqueur, although the lychee flavor did get muted over time. Recently, I've seen a few options for lychee liqueurs available in major liquor stores in the USA, but I haven't tried them out yet. However, one common "hack" for a drink that tends to go around as the Lychee Martini at many restaurants is to simply use syrup from canned lychees (Amazon options: [[1](https://amzn.to/4c8n1ZI), [2](https://amzn.to/3Ys7D78)]). 

Thus, recently an idea crossed my mind to make my own flavored soju by mixing clear soju and lychee syrup from a can. However, to further amp up the summer vibes I decided to carbonate the whole mixture to turn it into sparkling lychee soju that can be used on its own or to top off cocktails.

### [Sparkling Lychee Soju](/cocktails/infusions-recipes/sparkling-lychee-soju)

* 375 ml unflavored soju (~16.5% ABV)
* 200 ml lychee syrup (from a can of lychees)

Chill soju in the fridge ahead of time (this should help with carbonation). Combine all ingredients in an [iSi whipper](https://amzn.to/46CHzZi) and charge with one [CO2 cartridge](https://amzn.to/3A71ByZ). Shake a few times and put into the fridge for 30 to 45 minutes. After the wait, degas the container and add one more CO2 cartridge. Shake a few times and put into the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Degas the container, then unscrew the top and pour into cocktail of choice. Carbonation will keep a day or two if you keep resealing the container, but it's best to use the whole batch within a few hours for maximum effervescence.

With the carbonated lychee soju in hand we can make a few fun cocktails. 

### [Lychee Cocktail v1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/lychee-cocktail-v1)

* 1 oz white rum
* 0.75 oz lemon juice
* 1 barspoon 2:1 syrup
* 4 oz sparkling lychee soju

Shake all ingredients except the soju with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass. Top off with sparkling soju and optionally garnish with a single lychee fruit (no pit).

The drink is bright and floral with acidity form the lemon helping offset the sweetness of lychee soju. I used a very neutral Flor de Ca√±a white rum for this drink, but I believe it can be made more interesting by using a mild agricole rum (e.g. [Dillon Rhum Agricole Blanc 40% ABV](https://www.rhums-dillon.com/nos-gammes/rhums-blancs/rhum-blanc-dillon-40deg)) instead.

### [Lychee Spritz v1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/lychee-spritz-v1)

* 0.5 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz Falernum
* 3 oz sparkling lychee soju

Combine lime juice and Falernum in a well-chilled glass and stir briefly to mix. Top off with sparkling lychee soju. Alternatively, you can build this drink over pebble ice in a rocks glass in the same manner.

I prefer this made up, since Falernum and lychee experience a unique marriage of flavors that yields multi-layered floral aromas and a nuanced interplay of spices, sweetness and light tartness.

### [Lychee Rum Punch v1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/lychee-rum-punch-v1)

* 1 oz Jamaican overproof white rum ([William Price 124 proof](https://www.williampricedistilling.com/spirits))
* 0.5 oz [Batavia Arrack](https://alpenz.com/product-batavia.html)
* 0.25 oz Jamaican Pot Still Black Rum ([Hamilton](https://www.caribbean-spirits.com/labeldetails.php?id=52))
* 0.5 oz Falernum
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 4 oz sparkling lychee soju

Combine all ingredients except the soju in the shaker and shake with ice. Strain into a Collins glass packed with crushed ice. Top off with lychee soju and optionally garnish with a lychee fruit.

The mix of rums is strong and funky so the extra dilution from crushed ice is needed to keep this drink balanced. The sparkling soju top off keeps the aromas floral and fresh creating an interesting layering of flavors.

Overall the sparkling lychee soju seems to be a versatile ingredient that can be made quickly and used for a variety of cocktails. I believe that beyond the pairing with Falernum and rums, it would also pair well with gin based drinks by interacting with other botanicals. One thing of note is that most sojus available in groceries are not the most fine spirits, and the unflavored variety tends to be rather harsh tasting. Using a better soju can yield a smoother product to work with, so hunting down a good unflavored soju might be the next logical step.
