Last Friday I finally got to the [Anvil bar](https://www.anvilhouston.com/) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anvilhouston/?hl=en"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a> here in Houston. It's a really cozy and neat spot with a great selection of seasonal and classic cocktails. I was particularly happy about their "break even" bottle program where periodically a bottle of top shelf rare spirit gets poured at-cost (currently it is a bottle [Talisker 30 yo Scotch from 2022](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/230373/talisker-30-year-old)). However, on the cocktail side of things I really enjoyed the nitrogenated Cuba Libre. Hence this post, where I will try to approximate the drink by playing around with the concept. The original cocktail at Anvil is credited to Matt Tanner dated 2012.

### Profile

As a nitro cocktail this version of Cuba Libre had a nice smoothness to it both in the mouthfeel and taste. I picked up some molasses, as well as a chocolate and spice profile. Given that the recipe lists rums, cola, and bitters as the only ingredients my immediate guess was that the bitters are either [Bittermen's](https://www.instagram.com/bittermens/) Xocolatl Mole ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3LS5gmL)) or [Fee Brothers](https://www.feebrothers.com/) Aztec Chocolate ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4deax43)) bitters. Now, I also learned that there are Fee Brothers [Molasses bitters](https://www.feebrothers.com/product/molasses-bitters/) out there, which makes me doubt whether the molasses flavor I picked up was from a blackstrap rum or from molasses bitters. Beyond the molasses it was a bit hard for me to figure out what rums went into the blend, but the overall robust taste made me think of dark or gold rums.

### Design choices

Before I begin making nitro Cuba Libre, I wanted to get close enough in the flavor profile to the drink. I made two trial versions of the cocktail using some Mexican Coca-Cola, detailed below.

### Cuba Libre (test run #1)

* 1.5 oz Flor de Cana gold rum
* 0.5 oz Cruzan Blackstrap rum
* 0.5 oz lime juice
* 6 oz cola
* 1 dash Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate Bitters

Build in a Collins glass and gently stir with ice.

### Cuba Libre (test run #2)

* 1 oz Flor de Cana gold rum
* 0.75 oz Plantation Stiggin's Fancy Pineapple RUm
* 0.25 oz Cruzan Blackstrap rum
* 0.25 oz lime juice
* 4 oz cola
* 1 dash Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate Bitters

Build in a rocks glass then add one ice cube.

The first test run ended up too watery, making me wonder whether the version I tried at Anvil had concentrated Cola to some degree to get a better flavor. The second run was a lot closer to the mark in my opinion, indicating that the lower dilution ratio is part of the trick. Furthermore, the original recipe doesn't mention lime juice (and hence is more stable long term), so I consider removing it from teh spec for the next iteration. Additionally, since the Blackstrap rum is quite potent, I wondered whether tunning it down to a barspoon would be better. Finally, given that the pineapple rum work nicely here, I considered getting
