Flips are a interesting and unusual category of cocktails. While it's not uncommon to see an egg white being added into a shaken cocktail [[1](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/double-lemon-whiskey-sour)] for a nice frothy top, but the usage of a whole raw egg is mostly reserved for rare holiday treats like eggnog. Flips are the cocktails that fill this gap. They tend to feature bold aromatic dark spirits (dark rums, brandies) often accompanied by heavy cream and always a whole raw egg. The addition of the egg yolk produces rich cocktail that often feels like a dessert in a glass. Thus, it's not surprising that most often flips appear as the last drink of the night aka nightcap, and are more often featured in the dessert section of a menu.

In this post we will explore some classic flips, personalized variations on those, and some more experimental modern cocktails. Note, all of the cocktails listed here are also featured in the [cocktail recipes collection](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes) on this website.

## Cocktails

### [Rum Flip](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/rum-flip)

This is an old time classic flip that can accommodate a variety of rums. I prefer to use dark Jamaican rum here for a more bold and complex profile.

* 1.5 oz dark rum
* 0.5 oz heavy cream
* 0.25 oz 2:1 syrup
* 1 whole egg

Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake without ice. Add ice and shake again, strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.

I swapped 0.5 oz of the dark rum for blackstrap rum for a more molasses forward drink. The result is pleasant with coffee and chocolate notes from the dark rums and nice silky texture from the egg.

### [Rum Flip v2](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/rum-flip-v2)

* 2.75 oz Jamaican rum
* 0.25 oz allspice dram
* 1 tsp 2:1 Demerara syrup
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

Surprisingly light drink despite having a whole egg in it. Allspice nicely comes through without overtaking the drink.

### [Porto Flip](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/porto-flip)

* 1.75 oz ruby port
* 1 oz cognac
* 1 oz heavy cream
* 1 whole egg
* 1.5 tsp extra-fine sugar

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe, optionally add a barspoon of yellow Chartreuse and garnish with grated nutmeg.

This cocktail is smooth and silky with port wine taking the front seat. The cognac shows up in the aftertaste, while Chartreuse and nutmeg give this drink a festive spicy aroma preceding every sip.

### [Coffee Cocktail](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/coffee-cocktail)

This is a classic flip which owes its name to a look rather than an ingredient ([it has no coffee](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coffee-cocktail/)). Compared to a more modern Porto flip this drink has an equal ratio of cognac and ruby port, and doesn't include any cream.

* 1 oz cognac
* 1 oz ruby port
* 1 whole egg
* 0.5 oz 2:1 syrup

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

This cocktail is similar to the Porto flip, but with a sweeter and creamier feeling. The port is more pronounced in the beginning while the cognac shows in the aftertaste.

### [Cynar Flip](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/cynar-flip)

This recipe is due to Jayce Kadyschuk from [Clive's](https://clivesclassiclounge.com/) in Victoria, British Columbia. I found it on [Liquor.com](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cynar-flip/) while taking a deeper dive into modern flips.

* 1 oz rye whisky
* 1 oz Cynar
* 0.5 oz Cointreau
* 0.25 oz clove 2:1 syrup
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

The drink is very bold thanks to the 100 proof rye whisky and Cynar, but rich and creamy at the same time. This flip has a nice balance of bitterness, sweetness and rich mouthfeel that seems appropriate for a nightcap.

By a coincidence, a few nights ago [a reel](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8hi_s6JllR/) with a flip cocktail in it popped up on my Instagram feed. I wasn't able to quickly find a full reference for this but the description credits Sam Ross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samueljoelross/?hl=en"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a>. This looked like a fun drink to make, especially since I have a bottle of homemade banana liqueur lying around at the moment.

### [Bourbon Banana Flip](/cocktails/cocktail-recipes/bourbon-banana-flip)

* 1.5oz bourbon
* 0.75oz banana liqueur
* 0.5oz 2:1 syrup
* 0.5oz heavy cream
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake all ingredients, then add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe and garnish with grated nutmeg.

The drink turned out very pleasant albeit a touch too sweet for my taste. Bourbon comes through and banana flavor is present, but subtle. This is a great dessert drink recipe and a good use of banana liqueur, I am very glad that [@deadendwest](https://www.instagram.com/deadendwest/?g=5) reel brought this drink to my attention.

## Concluding Remarks

Despite using a whole egg flips are not as heavy as a serving of a good eggnog. In fact, they feel noticeably more airy and light than expected, while still having a silky rich mouthfeel. Furthermore, due to a healthy helping of other ingredients these cocktails have no trouble handling bold flavors and intense spices. Thus, they present a perfect opportunity to experiment with your favorite complex amaro or unusual funky spirit.
