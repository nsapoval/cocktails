Superjuice made out of strawberries.

---

<ul>
    <li> 100 g strawberry slices </li>
    <li> 20 g ascorbic acid</li>
    <li> 10 g citric acid</li>
    <li> 1 g MSG</li>
    <li> 500 g water</li>
</ul>

Combine strawberry slices with the acids and let sit in an airtight container for 30 minutes. Add water and MSG (optional) and blend to properly incorporate all ingredients. Filter out any solids and bottle. Keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Using acidity to pull out and amplify strawberry flavor gives a surprisingly different result compared to using sugar in strawberry syrup. While strawberry syrups tend to sometimes tasty jammy, the superjuice is extremely bright and reminds be of bitting into a nice fresh strawberry.
