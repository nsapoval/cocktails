<ul>
    <li> 500 grams peaches </li>
    <li> 450 grams sugar </li>
    <li> 225 grams water </li>
</ul>

Add the fruit slices reserved from the <a href="/cocktails/other-recipes/peach_bourbon">bourbon infusion</a> to a saucepan and cook on the low heat for 10 minutes occasionally stirring. Add sugar and water, and bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 10 minutes. Cool the mixture, and then add 2 grams of citric acid. Blend the mixture until smooth and bottle. Keeps refrigerated for up to 1 month.

I skipped the blending step and reserved the cooked down peaches for a peach marmalade. The flavor of the syrup ends up being good enough without the blending step, and skipping it likely will add a bit to the shelf-life of the syrup.
