An original recipe for strawberry and apple infused vodka.

---

<ul>
    <li> 15 g dried strawberries</li>
    <li> 20 g dried honeycrisp apples</li>
    <li> 250 g neutral grain spirit (75.5% ABV)</li>
    <li> 220 g water</li>
</ul>

In a jar combine dried fruit and grain spirit, let infuse for 48 hours. After infusing filter out the solids and add 220g of water. The mixture will be cloudy, so clarifying with a bit of pectic enzyme and additional filtering can be helpful for a cleaner look and longer shelf life.

The flavors are quite bright, but will dull out overtime, so it's best to use this infusion within two weeks or so. Keeping in the fridge should help extend the lifetime.
