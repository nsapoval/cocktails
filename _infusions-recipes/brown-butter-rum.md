A brown butter washed aged rum for hot and cold buttered rum applications.

---

* 750 ml aged rum (El Dorado 5 years old)
* 226.8 g (2 sticks) butter

Melt the butter in a pan on the stove top. Stir periodically until the milk solids start browning, you are looking for a medium-caramel color (ref: <span style="color:rgb(120,80,40)">&#9724;</span>) of the solids. Pour into a glass jar that can withstand high and low temperatures. Let the browned butter cool off a bit. Pour the bottle of rum into the butter and stir well. Keep stirring every 2-3 minutes for about 10-15 minutes. Then cap the jar and put in the freezer overnight. After freezing cut the block of fat on top of the jar with a knife and strain the contents through a cheesecloth (or nut milk bag) lined strainer. Bottle and refrigerate the butter washed rum. Should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.

I don't think it's worth messing with the coffee filtering this, since the clarity of the final product will still be somewhat dubious. Furthermore, there is a minute loss of the rum that happens throughout this process, so you won't get back exactly 750 ml you have started with.
