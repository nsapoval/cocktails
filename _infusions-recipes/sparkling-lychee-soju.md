A simple two ingredient flavored soju with extra fun added by the fizz.

---

* 375 ml unflavored soju (~16.5% ABV)
* 200 ml lychee syrup (from a can of lychees)

Chill soju in the fridge ahead of time (this should help with carbonation). Combine all ingredients in an iSi whipper and charge with one CO2 cartridge. Shake a few times and put into the fridge for 30 to 45 minutes. After the wait, degas the container and add one more CO2 cartridge. Shake a few times and put into the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Degas the container, then unscrew the top and pour into cocktail of choice. Carbonation will keep a day or two if you keep resealing the container, but it's best to use the whole batch within a few hours for maximum effervescence.

The resulting infusion is sweet and aromatic. Adding a touch of lemon juice and some ice can make it into a pleasant drink on its own. However, I mostly use this to top off cocktails.
