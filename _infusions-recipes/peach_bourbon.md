<ul>
    <li> 500 grams peaches </li>
    <li> 1 liter bourbon </li>
</ul>

In a jar combine ripe peach slices and bourbon infuse overnight, and then strain and bottle. Reserve all peach slices for peach syrup.

I ended up infusing the bourbon for approximately 24 hours instead of overnight. I used Wild Turkey 101 bourbon for the infusion (50.5% ABV). I tend to prefer higher proof bourbon for cocktails, since otherwise the flavor tends to fade into background too much especially with multiple ingredients in the mix, as a side benefit higher ABV also helps the flavor extraction form the peaches.
