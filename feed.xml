Clearly there are many ways to get these components into a drink, and thus like many classic template cocktails Bloody Mary is open to essentially infinite variations on the theme. Most of the ideas I am planning to test now have been around for a while. First, using kimchi for adding complexity with a touch of spice (and thus, satisfying point 2; see: [<a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/kimchi-bloody-mary">1</a>, <a href="https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/kimchi-bloody-mary/">2</a>]). Second, using fino sherry to compliment tomato flavor [<a href="https://imbibemagazine.com/elements-tomatoes/">3</a>]. Finally, deriving some additional umami from soy sauce and a touch of MSG. Thus, this experiment is not about discovery of a new flavor combination of profile, but rather an exercise in polishing and adjusting those flavors for personal taste.</p> <h2 id="tomato-base">Tomato base</h2> <p>I started by grabbing a can of whole peeled tomatoes (roughly 800 g total) and adding 100 g kimchi, 35 g dark soy sauce, and about 1 g of MSG. After blending all ingredients together I gto my first iteration of the tomato base. I decided to give it a go in a tomato base heavy basic variation on Bloody Mary as follows:</p> <h3 id="bloody-mary-v21">Bloody Mary v2.1</h3> <ul> <li>2 oz blanco tequila</li> <li>6 oz tomato base</li> <li>0.75 oz lemon juice</li> <li>1 barspoon 2:1 syrup</li> <li>3 dashes celery bitters</li> </ul> <p>The drink ended up being balanced and pleasant, but I felt that the kimchi did not contribute enough spice, and its flavor was lacking. Hence, I decided to adjust the tomato base proportions and up the kimchi content to bring its flavors into the focus and amplify the spice kick.</p> <h3 id="tomato-base-v02">Tomato Base v0.2</h3> <ul> <li>1 can whole peeled tomatoes (~800 g)</li> <li>250 g kimchi</li> <li>35 g dark soy sauce</li> <li>~1 g MSG</li> </ul> <p>The modified tomato base hit the flavor profile I wanted, being bright and having a distinct kimchi bite. The resulting product is a very chunky sauce rather than a smooth tomato juice you can get from the store. This didn’t make measuring out volumes more difficult, but I do suspect that this base might end up more heterogeneous. Beside using a better blender it is possible to opt for tomato juice instead of canned tomatoes in this recipe. However, from a practical standpoint of a home kitchen + bar I found it much more convenient to work with canned tomatoes (which I tend to have in my pantry) as opposed to tomato juice.</p> <h2 id="cocktails">Cocktails</h2> <p>With the tomato base being adjusted to my liking, I was happy to continue on the quest of optimizing Bloody Mary options. For the next iteration of the cocktail I wanted to first tune down the amount of the tomato base, since with a stronger kimchi flavor it would overpower the drink at a 6 oz pour. Furthermore, I wanted to work in some fino sherry, which on its own is a rather tricky ingredient to work with, but it tends to compliment vegetal flavors quite well. Thus, I arrived at the following cocktail:</p> <h3 id="bloody-mary-v22">Bloody Mary v2.2</h3> <ul> <li>2 oz blanco tequila</li> <li>1 oz fino sherry</li> <li>3 oz tomato base</li> <li>0.75 oz lemon juice</li> <li>1 barspoon 2:1 syrup</li> <li>3 dashes celery bitters</li> </ul> <p>The resulting cocktail is a lot more funky than the first draft. Kimchi flavor pops through and the spice is there to flesh out what I consider a Bloody Mary basic trait. The sherry is quite subtle, it is still possible to distinguish its key characteristics in the background, but on the forefront the cocktail is very much a vegetal and bright Bloody Mary.</p> <p>With the classic version of the Bloody Mary being more or less in the space I wanted it to be in, I decided to see if I can push the tomato base a bit further. The first idea that came to my mind was making something closer to an equal parts cocktail featuring sherry and tomato base. Given that the tomato base already has some acidity from the tomatoes and kimchi, and some added salinity from the soy sauce, a straight equal parts cocktail would likely end up too sour. Thus, I opted to curb down the lemon juice and keep it at 0.75 oz pour. Additionally, similarly to what I’ve been doing before I’ll keep adding 1 barspoon of 2:1 syrup to keep the flavors balanced. Finally, I wanted to switch the base spirit in order to give sherry more room without sacrificing too much of the botanical notes, thus I swapped tequila for gin.</p> <h3 id="bloodied-gin">Bloodied Gin</h3> <ul> <li>1 oz gin</li> <li>1 oz fino sherry</li> <li>1 oz tomato base</li> <li>0.75 oz lemon juice</li> <li>1 barspoon 2:1 syrup</li> <li>1 dash celery bitters</li> </ul> <p>Surprisingly while only having 1 ounce of the tomato base this cocktail yielded the boldest kimchi flavor. Furthermore, the sherry is a lot more prominent and compliments the tomato and fermentation notes from the base. Being more acidic makes this cocktail less of a salad in a glass, and more of a proper aperitif that can be consumed before the meal or alongside the appetizers (I’d pair some carpaccio, steak tartare or burrata with this cocktail).</p> <p>Generally, at this point I am pretty happy with the experiment, and got at two cocktails that I’d like to serve to other people, and keep for my own records. However, so far we have been mostly experimenting with the classic recipes or relatively fail-safe formulas. In the spirit of true R&amp;D session we need to take this further by descending into <del>radical sandwich anarchy</del>[<a href="https://flowingdata.com/2017/05/02/sandwich-alignment-chart/">4</a>] cocktail madness.</p> <h2 id="one-step-further">One step further</h2> <p>What we got so far with the Bloodied Gin cocktail is a tart, slightly spicy, vegetal aperitif. Now, let’s do two things at once, first we will try to amplify sherry making it the center spirit of the drink, and second we will turn this drink from chunky salsa to a clear and refined beverage.</p> <p>We will attempt to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74fsCUdQAtw">milk clarify</a> a part of our cocktail and then combine the clarified drink with fino sherry. For the clarified part we will need:</p> <ul> <li>2 oz gin</li> <li>2 oz tomato base</li> <li>1.5 oz lemon juice</li> <li>0.25 oz 2:1 syrup</li> <li>3 dashes celery bitters</li> </ul> <p>We will combine all of these ingredients together and then pour them over 2 ounces of milk. Lightly stir the mixture after combining, since some of the cocktail might not be well exposed to milk due to its chunky consistency. Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes, and then filter it through strainer + nut milk bag + coffee filter setup.</p> <p>Filtering milk and cocktail mixture takes a lot longer than with a bigger batch of whiskey sour or rum punch that I’ve done before. I am not sure if that’s due to the more solids present in the mix or due to the smaller sieve and hence tighter fit of the filtering layers.</p> <p>At this stage the milk clarified portion of the drink has a characteristic pizza smell to it owing to mixture of milk and canned tomatoes.</p> <p>For the final cocktail assemble:</p> <ul> <li>2 oz clarified mixture</li> <li>1 oz fino sherry</li> </ul> <p>Stir the ingredients with ice and pour into a coupe glass. The result is quite acidic and bright. There is no spiciness in this drink, but the fermented flavors of the kimchi carry through. The sherry is a lot more pronounced compared to the previous version, which fit sour design choices. Unlike clarified punches and sours this drink doesn’t seem to have the smooth and silky mouthfeel despite the milk clarification. Overall this is a step in an interesting direction, but quite far from a finished cocktail.</p> <p>A few options for future trials could include making a clarified and acid adjusted tomato juice and infusing a base spirit with kimchi.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research-and-development"/><category term="bloody-mary"/><category term="kimchi"/><category term="spicy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimizing Bloody Mary recipe(s)]]></summary></entry></feed>
